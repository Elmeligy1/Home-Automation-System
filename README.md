# Home Automation System

This project is a Home Automation System designed for the Electric & Electronic Circuits course. It uses an ESP8266 microcontroller and Blynk for remote monitoring and control.

## Components

- **DHT11 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **MQ2 Gas Sensor**: Detects gas levels.
- **Flame Sensor**: Detects the presence of fire.
- **PIR Sensor**: Monitors motion.

## Features

- **Remote Monitoring**: Real-time sensor data available on the Blynk app.
- **Safety Alerts**: Buzzer activates under hazardous conditions.
- **Automated Control**: Controls home appliances through relays.
- **User Interface**: Configurable via the Blynk app.
